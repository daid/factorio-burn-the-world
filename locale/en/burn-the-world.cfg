clean-coal=Remove all impurities from dirty coal to make it burn more efficient, and allow it to be used as ingredient for coal based products.
powdered-coal=Grind coal down into a more effecient form for burning. This increases the power efficency of burning the coal and thus effectively you get more power out of the same amount of coal.
burner-fuel-assembling-machine=Allows for a smaller assembling machine specially designed for processing fuels.
